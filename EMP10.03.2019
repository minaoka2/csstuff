// Problems using substring

// Write a function that returns the number of a particular target letter within some i and j of a String using substring.
public String targetLetter(String word, int i, int j) {

}


// Problems using classes

// Write a Shape class that has:
// One class variable that keeps track of the number of Shapes made
// One constructor that will increment our class variable
// One instance method, getArea, that returns 0.
// Next, write three children classes called Rectangle, Triangle, and Circle.
// Each of these should implement their own getArea and should store instance variables for properties

// Now, write an Animal class that has one instance method: speak();
// Create children of this class (Dog, Cat, Bird, and Fox) that each implements speak();

// Now, try experimenting with creating objects of these classes and practicing some polymorphism concepts
